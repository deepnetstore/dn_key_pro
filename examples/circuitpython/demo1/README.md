# dn key pro demo1 example code

To use this example, copy all of the files in the  `demo1` folder  
into the DN_KEY_PY drive and replace any files already existing.
(make sure you back up your old code first if you want to use it again!)

We always recommend that you work on your circuitpython *.py files on your
local machine and copy everything over each time. If you want to make changes, 
edit this code and then copy the changed files over to the Key Pro.
